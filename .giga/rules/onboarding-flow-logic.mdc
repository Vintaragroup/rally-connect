# onboarding-flow-logic

Multi-step onboarding workflow implementing role-based user progression through team creation and joining processes.

## Core Flow Components

### Role-Based Onboarding (src/components/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx)
- Distinct flows for "player" vs "captain" roles
- State machine managing progression through onboarding steps
- Different requirements and validations per role
- Returning user detection with modified flow paths
Importance Score: 90/100

### Team Creation Workflow (src/components/onboarding/CreateTeamScreen.tsx)  
- Sport-specific team formation logic (bocce, pickleball, padel)
- Required metadata validation by sport type
- Club/location association handling
- Team formation requirements enforcement
Importance Score: 85/100

### Player Invitation System (src/components/onboarding/InvitePlayersScreen.tsx)
- Dual invitation mechanisms:
  1. Team code generation and distribution
  2. Bulk email invitation processing
- Invitation state tracking
- Role-specific invitation permissions
Importance Score: 80/100

### Team Joining Logic (src/components/onboarding/JoinTeamScreen.tsx)
- Team code validation workflow
- Team search with sport/captain filtering
- Membership eligibility verification
